## Slide 2: The Problem – Broken Aid in a Chaotic World (0:25 - 0:50)

### Visual Layout
* **Headline:** The Crisis Supply Chain Trilemma
* **3 Pain Points:**
  1. **Global Instability Surge:** Disasters and conflicts are rising; millions need urgent medical and material aid.
  2. **Nefarious Actors & Scalping:** Hostile forces, warlords, and black-market cartels intercept shipments and scalp essential trauma kits, insulin, and blood plasma.
  3. **The Technology Failure:** Centralized databases get raided or hacked. Public blockchains like Ethereum broadcast hospital GPS coordinates and casualty surges to the entire world, turning medical clinics into missile targets.

### 🎙️ Speaker Script (25 Seconds)
> "Every time you turn on the news, there's a natural disaster here, or an escalating conflict there. Sadly, this means more and more innocent people need urgent financial and material support.
> 
> But the reality on the ground is grim: nefarious players limit how much aid gets through, steal shipments, and scalp life-saving medication. Centralized databases expose clinic locations to hostile raids, while public chains like Ethereum turn hospital supply flows into public military targets. We need a private, trustless bridge."

## Slide 3: The Iron Flower Solution & Live Demo (0:50 - 1:30)

### Visual Layout
* **Headline:** The Unwilting Flower in Hostile Climates
* **Live Demo Display (`http://localhost:8088`):**
  * **1. Atomic DvP Medical Delivery:** Verified batch handoff + instant courier escrow payout.
  * **2. WHO ICD-11 & SNOMED-CT EHR:** Diagnostic coding, point-of-care bloods panel (`O-Neg`, `Hb: 6.4 g/dL`, `Lactate: 4.8 mmol/L`), and encrypted ultrasound telemetry.
  * **3. Cryptographic Audit Root:** SHA-256 Merkle audit trail linked to Canton escrow without leaking patient identity.

### 🎙️ Speaker Script (40 Seconds)
> "With this in mind, I built the **Iron Flower Protocol**—symbolizing how an unwilting flower can survive and bloom in the harshest climates. It is built natively on the **Canton Network**, and here is a demo of our live solution.
> 
> As you can see on the screen, Iron Flower tracks supplies end-to-end:
> When a local courier delivers emergency trauma packs to a frontline clinic, the clinic cryptographically accepts delivery. Their medical inventory is updated immediately, unlocking the courier's escrow payment with **zero counterparty risk**.
> 
> Additionally, these clinical encounters are coded to **WHO ICD-11 and SNOMED-CT standards**—making it easy for attending clinicians to log tests, blood panels, consultations, and diagnoses in an auditable manner through an on-ledger Merkle audit tool, while maintaining strict zero-knowledge patient privacy."

## Slide 4: Under the Hood – Engineering Breakthroughs (1:30 - 2:10)

### Visual Layout
* **Headline:** Solving the Hardest Engineering Challenges on Canton
* **Comparison & Architecture:**
  * **Track A1 (Resilient Scanner):** Zero-dependency stdlib Python indexer querying Active Contract Sets (ACS) via `InterfaceFilter: Splice.Holding` + SQLite WAL continuous offset checkpointing (0 dropped events on crash).
  * **Track A2 (Drift Sentinel):** Sub-25ms invariant verification catching stuck submissions, ghost contracts, and negative balances + 3.6ms auto-reconciliation.
  * **Zero-Trust Security & Anti-Spoofing:** Non-spoofable party multihashes (`Party::1220...`), anti-replay nonces, and Keycloak OAuth / `CanActAs` access framework.

### 🎙️ Speaker Script (40 Seconds)
> "Under the hood, I addressed two of the hardest engineering challenges on Canton:
> 
> First, for **Track A1 (The Scanner)**: Canton has no public block explorer. I built a zero-dependency Python indexer that queries the Active Contract Set via interface filters, streams live transaction trees, and continuously checkpoints offsets to SQLite in WAL mode. You can kill the process mid-stream and it resumes with zero dropped events.
> 
> Second, for **Track A2 (Catch the Drift)**: Databases drift from the ledger. Our **Drift Sentinel** continuously checks invariants. When an uncommitted ghost holding or tampered inventory is injected, our engine catches it in **23 milliseconds** and automatically reconciles back to ledger truth in **3.6 milliseconds**.
> 
> Furthermore, all Daml choices enforce single-use nonces and non-spoofable cryptographic ownership, preventing copy-paste replay attacks."

## Slide 5: Edge-Mesh Mode & 94% Bandwidth Savings (2:10 - 2:30)

### Visual Layout
* **Headline:** Frontline Resilience: Low-Data & Offline Mesh Mode
* **Metrics:**
  * 📡 **>94% Network Traffic Reduction** via payload compression and delta sync.
  * 🔄 **Multi-Node Failover:** Primary Validator (14ms) 🔄 SV Proxy (28ms) 🔄 Local Mesh (2ms).
  * 🛡️ **Zero Service Interruption** during communications blackouts.

### 🎙️ Speaker Script (20 Seconds)
> "Due to the nature of where healthcare workers are deployed, we accounted for poor internet connectivity and added an **Edge-Mesh Mode**.
> 
> This mode batches transactions and saves over **94% of network traffic**, ensuring medical services can operate over fragile satellite or 2G connections. If the primary validator goes down, the client seamlessly fails over to fallback SV nodes or local offline mesh participants without interrupting critical surgical care."

## Slide 6: Honest Trade-Offs & Trust Boundaries (2:30 - 2:45)

### Visual Layout
* **Headline:** Rigorous Trust Model & Governance
* **3 Honesty Disclosures:**
  1. **Super-Validator Consortium:** Trusted governance by vetted humanitarian bodies (UN agencies, Red Cross, Swiss foundations) rather than anonymous miners.
  2. **Physical Oracle Pairing:** Daml cryptographic signatures prove receipt by authorized medical keys; paired with tamper-evident NFC packaging.
  3. **Selective Auditability:** Regulators inspect compliance via disclosed contracts without viewing unrelated field clinic patient data.

### 🎙️ Speaker Script (15 Seconds)
> "To be completely transparent about our trust boundaries: Canton is not trustless. We trust a federation of vetted humanitarian super-validators not to collude, and we pair cryptographic Daml signatures with physical tamper-evident seals. For conflict zones, this regulated, confidential trust model is far safer than public chain exposure."

## 🎯 Quick Q&A Cheat Sheet (For Tough Judge Questions)

* **Q: How do you prevent someone from copying a Daml contract call or spoofing a doctor's signature?**
  * **A:** *"Daml party IDs are cryptographic public key fingerprints (`Party::1220...`), making imitation impossible without the private key. Additionally, Daml choices archive the contract upon execution, and our nonces guarantee that replayed or copied contract calls fail immediately with a duplicate-spend rejection."*
* **Q: Why not use zero-knowledge proofs on Ethereum?**
  * **A:** *"ZKPs hide the payload, but Ethereum block explorers still broadcast transaction timing, gas usage, and wallet addresses. In a conflict zone, monitoring transaction frequency reveals when and where an underground surgical unit is active. Canton's sub-transaction privacy ensures non-signatory nodes receive zero bytes."*
* **Q: Can you demonstrate the drift detector catching an error right now?**
  * **A:** *"Yes! (On the Drift Sentinel tab at `http://localhost:8088`, click 'Inject Spoofed Signature' or 'Inject Stuck Ghost Contract' ➡️ show the instant red alert in 23ms ➡️ click 'Trigger Auto-Reconcile' to show the sub-4ms repair)."*
